#Project 1: Grid Lock

Grid Lock is a classic spacial awareness puzzle game. The goal is to maneuver the red block around and between the other blocks to escape through the exit on the opposite side.

Rules are simple:
- You can move any piece on the board.
- Blocks move either up and down or left to right.
- Levels get progessively harder as you complete each one.
- You will be timed, but don't worry. Your time will display as a personal best once you have completed the level.

Aside from that, enjoy the game!
